    <h1>History</h1>
    Idukki District came into existence on the 26th January, 1972dated the 24th January, 1972, carving out Devikulam, Udumbanchola and Peerumade Taluks from erstwhile Kottayam District and Thodupuzha Taluk (excluding Kalloorkad Village and portion of Manjalloor Village included in Kalloorkad and Manjalloor Panchayats) of erstwhile Ernakulam District. The jurisdiction was slightly altered by a subsequent dated the 14th February, 1972. The name Idukki was derived from the word ‘Idukku’ which means a gorge.
    The pre-history of the District is shrouded in obscurity. We have no clear evidence about the Palaeolithic period. The uru buriah, the vaults called pandukuzhies, menhirs, dolmens and graves found in high ranges and hills date back to the Megalithic period. The excavation of the State Archaeology Department in Marayoor in the Anchunad Valley of Devikulam Taluk, Thengakkal near Vandiperiyar, Bison Valley and Thondermalai show distinct characteristics of pre-historic civilization. The dolmens and menhirs discovered from these places show the cultural and well developed civilization of inhabitants of the Megalithic period. It is worth mentioning that, this District had an important role in the spice trade of ancient period as spices such as pepper, cardamom, etc., grow more in abundance in this District than elsewhere in the State.
