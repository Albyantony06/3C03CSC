      <h1>Tourist spots</h1>
      <h2>Munnar</h2>
      Munnar was the summer resort of the British Government in the south. The town is situated at the convergence of three mountain streams, namely Muthirappuzha, Nallathanni, and Kundala. Munnar has some of the largest tea plantations in the world. This hill station, which is more than 5,000 feet above sea level, is a tourist attraction noted for its scenic landscapes.[citation needed] Most of the native flora and fauna of Munnar have disappeared due to severe habitat fragmentation resultant from the creation of the plantations. However, some species continue to survive and thrive in several protected areas nearby, including the new Kurinjimala Sanctuary to the east, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Manjampatti Valley, and the Amaravati reserve forest of Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary to the northeast, the Eravikulam National Park and Anamudi Shola National Park in the north, and the Pampadum Shola National Park to the south. The Palani Hills National Park is proposed to come up to the east of Idukki. These protected areas are especially known for several threatened and endemic species including the Nilgiri tahr, the grizzled giant squirrel, the Nilgiri wood-pigeon, the elephant, the gaur, the Nilgiri langur, the sambar, and the neelakurinji (that blossoms only once in twelve years).

The former Kunda Valley Railway in Munnar was destroyed by a flood in 1924, but tourism officials are considering reconstructing the railway line to attract tourists.
      <h3>Vagamon</h3>
      Vagamon is a hill station situated 1,200 meters above sea level, 37 km from Pala and 42 km from Thodupuzha.

This hill station provides options of trekking, para gliding or rock climbing for adventure-seekers, and has many varieties of flora and fauna. Evergreen trees, tall grasses, and shrubs are present in the lower regions of Vagamon. Many rare species of birds, insects, wild buffaloes, and elephants can be easily located in the forests. The main attractions here are mist-covered mountains and lakes, pilgrim centers (Kurishumala, Murugan temple, and burial chamber of a Sufi saint), and pine forests.
      <h4>Ramakkalmedu</h4>
      Ramakkalmedu (രാമക്കൽമേട്‌) is a hill station and hamlet in the Idukki district. It is located about 15 km from Nedumkandam on the Munnar-Thekkady route.

Ramakalmedu stands tall in the Western Ghats at a height of 3,500 feet above sea level. The ecosystem of the area consists largely of Shola forest-grasslands, with sporadic bamboo forests.

Constant wind is another factor that makes Ramakkalmedu unique. The wind blows at a speed around 35 km/hour throughout the year, irrespective of the season and time. Tourist villages like Pushpakandam and Kuruvikanam near Ramakkalmedu are home to private wind energy farms, with a capacity of about 12.5 MW. This electricity is distributed to the Kerala State Electricity Board. Ramakkalmedu has the potential to produce more electricity, as it is said to be one of the most windy areas in Asia.[citation needed]

      <h5>Thekkady</h5>
      Thekkady is located close to the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border, about 257 km (160 mi) from Trivandrum, 140 km from Madurai City and Madurai Airport, 145 km from Cochin International Airport, and 114 km from Kottayam railway station. The sanctuary at Thekkady is known for its dense evergreen and semi-evergreen, moist deciduous forests and savanna grass lands. It is home to herds of elephants, sambar, tigers, gaur, lion-tailed macaques and Nilgiri langurs.

The Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary is spread across 777 km2 (300 sq mi), of which 360 km2 (140 sq mi) is thick evergreen forest. The wildlife sanctuary was declared a tiger reserve in 1978. The splendid artificial lake formed by the Mullaperiyar Dam across the Periyar River adds to the charm of the park. The greatest attractions of Periyar are the herds of wild elephants, deer, and bison that come down to drink in the lake. The sanctuary can be accessed through a trekking route, boating, or jeep safari. Thekkady is considered a haven for natural spices such as black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, nutmace, ginger, and clove.
      <h6>Marayur</h6>
      Marayur is a remote village on the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats. Relics of the New Stone Age have been unearthed here. It has ancient stone cabins, called 'Muniyaras', and is the only place in Kerala with natural growth of sandalwood trees. Marayur has more than 1,000 species of flowering plants and is a well-known repository of medicinal plants. There are 114 endemic species and the sighting of Albizia lathamii, a critically endangered tree, was recently reported from the dry forests. Chinnar – the wildlife sanctuary in Marayur – has recorded the largest number of reptilian species, including the mugger crocodile, in Kerala. With 225 recorded species of birds, it is one of the richest areas in avian diversity in South India. The forests in Marayur preserve a population of the endangered grizzled giant squirrel. The rare white bison has been recently reported in Chinnar wildlife sanctuary. Other important mammals found are elephant, tiger, leopard, gaur, sambar, spotted deer, Nilgiri thar, common langur, bonnet macaque, etc. The phenomenon of butterfly migration occurs in between the monsoons.

Maryoor has got a number of sandalwood forests. Processing of sandalwood and its associated oil forms part of the local economy and a depot near Marayur town is supporting this industry. Sandal wood or Santalum album is a parasitic tree having a fragrant and close-grained yellowish heartwood. Sandalwood oil, also known as ‘liquid gold,’ is extracted from the roots and wood of sandalwood. This oil is a costly item marketed at a few choosy outlets all over the state. A climate with low rainfall is suitable for the growth of choice sandalwood trees from which good quality oil can be extracted. The 93 km2 Marayur reserve forest is believed to have about sixty thousand naturally grown sandalwood trees, of which nearly 2,000 trees had been allegedly plundered in just one year since January 2004, when the last survey was conducted. The auction-rate for first quality Marayur sandal is quoted at Rs.1100 per kg, according to forest department sources (2004).

Kosamattam Plantation located 3861 Feet above sea level and is ideally located on border belt of the Western Ghats in Idukki district of Kerala. Just 10 Km from Kattapana town and around 23 Km from Kumaly town, this estate is in the location of the cardamom belt of Idukki district.
